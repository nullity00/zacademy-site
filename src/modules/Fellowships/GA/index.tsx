                  Auditing is a lonely business, but it doesn’t have to be that
                  way

                <br />
                <li>
                  If you have a strong track record in the security space
                  (previous group auditing experience, multiple podium finishes
                  on code4rena or Sherlock, Immunefi bounties, or outstanding
                  security research), we welcome you to be our guest for 1-2
                  weeks and audit alongside our usual residents.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  You will be prepped and supported by our resident auditors and
                  core staff. All you have to do is show up, review code, and
                  engage with our residents and fellows for the duration of the
                  engagement.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  You will be given access to the codebase well in advance to
                  familiarize yourself with it. Our auditing sprints are a mix
                  of sync calls and async discussions. Our fellows work in
                  groups, and you’ll have access to their groups to participate
                  and mentor, alongside our resident auditors who are always
                  there as well.
